= Goals =
In summary, our project should aim to achieve the following:
  * Perform segmentation of a string into its individual characters
  * Perform recognization/inference of each character by using SVMs
  * Incorporate some form a `prior' in order to improve the inference
    * For example, dictionary matching of words
  * Incorporate one or more of the following extensions
    * Conditional Random Fields as a type of prior
    * Robust Learning
    * Semi-supervised Learning
